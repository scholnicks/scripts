scripts
=======
This is a collection of scripts that I have developed over the years to make my life easier. I have decided to share them.
They come with no warranty, but I can offer email support. Most of the these scripts are still
under active development. All scripts have been tested under macOS, but they should run under any *nix.

There is a little documentation (via --help command line parameter) but most of the scripts are self-explanatory.

All are published under a MIT license. See https://scholnick.net/license.txt for details.
